As you can see, to describe myself as an individual is not an easy task! I am a person who finds inspiration in stories about travel and loves watching birds yet I am also an unstoppable city walker and dancing enthusiast listening to music most of my free time. How does that relate to coding, you would ask? Strangely but it all does come together in my mind. Physical sensations of colors, tastes, sounds and smells create excitation. After recharging my energies in quiet, I go out to take in London cityscapes either by walking or dancing. That inspires visions of life in me. Those visions make me realise possibilities for new designs yet to be realised - designs that can be silly and old or sometimes brave and bold. For most of the times, those designs require coding. And here I am, applying for software developer job and hoping that Futureproof will become my springboard into the future."},

                You can call me a developer, or an engineer, or even a dancer. Or you can simply call me a human. 
                Latter describes me most accurately. However you prefer to call me, I do not fit well into any of the categories. 
                There is just something that I do and something that I do not. That is the most appropriate way to describe me.

                I do not discriminate people based on their origins. I do believe in the virtue of good actions and good deeds.<br/>
                I do not defend my ideas blindly, which can prevent me from learning. I do seek out truth and attempt to see things as they really are.<br/>
                I do not seek power and measure of personal self-worth in ruling over others and telling people what to do. I do seek companionship and follow common interests to learn from each other and improve as a whole.<br/> 
            </p>
